# Volatu
This project is a WordPress website prototype created as part of a UI/UX and navigation improvement assignment for Volatus Aerospace.
It includes an improved header navigation system, structured footer, modern Elementor-based layout, and a clear page hierarchy designed to enhance user experience, clarity, and accessibility.
